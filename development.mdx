<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:

  - A ManyPI API key ([obtain here](https://app.manypi.com/dashboard/api-access)).
  - An active ManyPI subscription.
</Info>

Follow these steps to implement ManyPI in your application or workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your scraper">
    Visit the ManyPI Dashboard and click **“Create Scraper.”**\
    Enter the URL of the webpage you want to convert into an API, then confirm.

    Next, describe the data you want to extract—for example:\
    **“Retrieve all product names and prices for items currently in stock.”**

    Our AI will generate a type-safe JSON schema based on your requirements. After you confirm it, we’ll automatically create a new API endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your API endpoint">
    Once your scraper is set up, you’ll receive a custom API endpoint that you can use to run data extractions. The route will look like this:

    ```bash
    https://app.manypi.com/api/scrape/your-endpoit-id-here
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use your API endpoint">
    Now you can use cURL to integrate your new API into any environment, application or workflow that supports REST APIs. Use it with your API key:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST 'https://app.manypi.com/api/scrape/your-endpoit-id-here' 
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' 
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
    -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting responses

By default, responses are processed synchronously, and each request has a 60-second timeout.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: Insufficient credits">
    This means your account has run out of credits, which are required to run extraction tasks (your scrapers). Each extraction uses a certain amount of credits based on the volume of data processed and the compute required by our AI and extraction engine.

    1. Upgrade to a higher (paid) plan.
    2. Purchase add-on credits (if on a paid plan).

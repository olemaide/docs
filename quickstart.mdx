## Get started in two ways

Choose your preferred method: use the web interface for quick testing or integrate via API for production use.

## Option 1: Web Interface (No Code)

Perfect for testing and one-off scraping tasks.

### Step 1: Create your account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Go to [app.manypi.com](https://app.manypi.com) and create your free account. You'll get 20,000 credits to start.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify email">
    Check your inbox and verify your email address to activate your account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create your first scraper

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Use AI to generate your scraper">
    1. Click **"Create Scraper"** in your dashboard
    2. Enter a target URL (e.g., `https://example.com/product`)
    3. Describe what data you want to extract in plain English:
       - "Extract the product title, price, and rating"
       - "Get all article titles and publication dates"
       - "Scrape company name, location, and job listings"
    4. Click **"Generate Schema"** - AI will create the data structure
    5. Review and adjust the schema if needed
    6. Click **"Create Scraper"**
    
    <Tip>Be specific in your prompt for better results. Include field names and data types you expect.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Or define schema manually">
    If you prefer full control, you can manually define your JSON schema:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "title": { "type": "string" },
        "price": { "type": "string" },
        "rating": { "type": "number" },
        "inStock": { "type": "boolean" }
      },
      "required": ["title", "price"]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Test your scraper

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run a test">
    Click **"Run Now"** on your scraper to test it with the target URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View results">
    See the extracted data in clean, structured JSON format. Results appear instantly in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine if needed">
    If the results aren't perfect, edit your scraper's prompt or schema and test again. Each test only costs credits when successful.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **Success!** You've created and tested your first scraper. Now you can run it anytime from the dashboard.
</Check>

## Option 2: API Integration (Production)

Perfect for automation, scheduled jobs, and production applications.

### Step 1: Get your API key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to settings">
    Go to **Settings** → **API Keys** in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate key">
    Click **"Create API Key"**, give it a name, and copy the key. 
    
    <Warning>Store it securely - you won't be able to see it again!</Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create a scraper

Follow the same process as the web interface to create and test your scraper. You'll need the scraper ID for API calls.

<Tip>Find your scraper ID in the dashboard - it's shown in the scraper details.</Tip>

### Step 3: Make your first API call

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST \
  'https://app.manypi.com/api/scrape/YOUR_SCRAPER_ID' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com/product/123"
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://app.manypi.com/api/scrape/YOUR_SCRAPER_ID', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: 'https://example.com/product/123'
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://app.manypi.com/api/scrape/YOUR_SCRAPER_ID',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={
        'url': 'https://example.com/product/123'
    }
)

data = response.json()
print(data)
```

```php PHP
<?php
$ch = curl_init('https://app.manypi.com/api/scrape/YOUR_SCRAPER_ID');

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type: application/json'
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode([
    'url' => 'https://example.com/product/123'
]));

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$data = json_decode($response, true);

print_r($data);
?>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 4: Handle the response

```json Response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "title": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
    "price": "$79.99",
    "rating": 4.5,
    "inStock": true
  },
  "metadata": {
    "scraperId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "tokensUsed": 1500,
    "creditsCost": 1500,
    "creditsRemaining": 8500
  }
}
```

<Check>
  **You're live!** Your scraper is now integrated and ready for production use.
